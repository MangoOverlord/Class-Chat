# Class-Chat
A chatting application for use between students.
Class Chat is a web based application that simulates real time classroom conversations. With this, students are able to enter a classroom of their choice and send messages visible to both sides. The unlimited number of possible chatrooms allows students to start out in a central class chat and then create more specialized forumsâ€”all, of course, accessible by their fellow colleagues.
